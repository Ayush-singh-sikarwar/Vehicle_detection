# Vehicle Detection using YOLOv3 and OpenCV

This project demonstrates how to perform vehicle detection in images or video using the YOLOv3 (You Only Look Once) object detection model and OpenCV in Python.

## Prerequisites

Before running the code, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (cv2)
- numpy

You'll also need the YOLOv3 files:
- `yolov3.weights`: Pre-trained weights file
- `yolov3.cfg`: Configuration file
- `coco.names`: Class names file

You can download these files from the official YOLO website or repository.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/vehicle-detection.git
   cd vehicle-detection
   
Customization
You can customize the project by adjusting the confidence threshold, tweaking parameters, or using different pre-trained models for object detection.
